      <p>
        I’m a woodworker who believes in quiet craft, slow process, and the kind of work that reveals itself layer by layer.
        Every piece begins with curiosity — grain, weight, resonance — and ends with something meant to be lived with, not just looked at.
      </p>

      <p>
        My shop sits in the trees of Rainier, Washington, where I carve, shape, and finish each piece by hand.
        CNC carving, traditional joinery, and modern finishing techniques all meet here in a workflow that’s equal parts precision and intuition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windwood Woodworking is my way of sharing that process.
        If a piece speaks to you, or if you’re imagining something custom, I’m always open to conversation.
