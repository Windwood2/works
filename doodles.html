      <p class="page-description">A playful corner for remembering sketches and experiments with curves from my 
         high school and early college years. </p>
	     <p class="page-description">     For me, art has never been about copying the surface of the world. It’s been a way of training perception. When you sit with a blank page long enough, you start noticing what your mind tries to do: rush, control, imitate, finish, impress. The page becomes a mirror. Making things—sketching, carving, building—teaches patience, not as a moral virtue, but as a practical skill: the ability to stay with uncertainty without panicking. Over time, you learn to trust that clarity can be grown rather than forced, and that real work often looks “unproductive” right up until the moment it becomes obvious why it mattered.</p>
		<p class="page-description">    People will call certain kinds of attention “distraction” because they don’t fit the usual script of productivity. But not every detour is a mistake. Some forms of distraction are actually a refusal to be drafted into a life you didn’t choose. There’s a difference between distraction that numbs you and distraction that nourishes you. One makes time disappear and leaves you emptier. The other makes time disappear and leaves you more awake. It’s worth learning that difference early, because it quietly shapes everything—what you become good at, what you believe is possible, what you’re willing to risk.</p>

         <p class="page-description">    A life is built out of hours. Whatever you repeatedly spend time on becomes your inner architecture—your instincts, your confidence, your taste, your courage, your tolerance for discomfort. If you spend your days performing for approval, you’ll build a self that needs approval to function. If you spend your days practicing curiosity, you’ll build a self that can walk into the unknown without needing permission. And if you deliberately ignore some loud “opportunities” that everyone else chases, you preserve a kind of freshness—space for the extraordinary to land, room for a real desire to surface, time for your own questions to ripen.</p>

         <p class="page-description">    So my philosophy is simple and demanding: choose pursuits that make you more alive, not just more impressive. Build a practice you can keep—something physical and honest, where you make contact with reality: a page, a tool, a piece of wood, a camera, a notebook. Let your work teach you who you are before you force it to become a product, a persona, or a career. You don’t have to know the final destination to begin. You just have to start showing up in the direction of what feels true—and be willing to disappoint the part of the world that preferred you more predictable.
