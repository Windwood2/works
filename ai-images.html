      <p class="page-description">I start in Stable Diffusion (SDXL) inside ComfyUI, but I treat it less like “image making” and more like concept carving: the prompt is a design brief, and SDXL is my sketch engine. Once I land on an image with the right flow, depth cues, and surface rhythm, I stay in ComfyUI to translate that picture into a depth map—turning the visual into a topographic instruction set where highs and lows are now meaningful. From there it becomes woodworking again: I prep the relief so it will carve cleanly (controlling contrast, smoothing artifacts, keeping edges intentional), then move into BobCAD/CAM to do the real translation from “terrain” to toolpaths—choosing the cutters, stepovers, feeds/speeds, and pass strategy that preserve delicate contours without turning them into chatter or mush. The CNC cuts the bas-relief into walnut, or my wood of choice and then the human part comes back in: brass brush work to open the grain and reveal micro-ridges, sanding to tame the machining signature while keeping the crispness I want, and finally wipe-on poly to lock the surface, deepen the walnut, and make the relief catch light the way it was always meant to. In the end, it’s words → image → depth → toolpath → wood → finish—a continuous chain where each step is a different language expressing the same idea, and the “AI” part is simply one of the tools I use to get to a physical object with presence.</p>

      Image created through text prompt in AI. The prompt read "arial view, hazy and blurry, 3d bas relief, flying over patterns of undulating sandy ocean bottom, crafted by underwater currents and harsh water waves flowing over the surface, highly detailed and carved in smooth white stone"  And this is one of many images created.
