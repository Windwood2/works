      <p class="page-description">Thoughts on craft, process, and meaning.<p>
	  
	 I have always been interested in how everything belongs together. When I was young, I noticed patterns in nature, in people, and in my own thoughts — shapes repeating, feelings echoing, stories looping back on themselves. Later I learned words like *fractals* and *entanglement*, but the idea was already there: nothing is truly separate. Even when things look far apart or different, they come from the same beginning. My artwork has always followed this curiosity. I don’t try to copy the world as it looks on the surface. I try to show how it feels underneath — like everything is connected by an invisible order.<br><br>
	 
	 For a long time, I thought I was just the character I was playing in life: my name, my job, my habits, my fears. But over time I began to sense something larger and quieter behind that character — a deeper self that was watching, choosing, and learning through experience. This helped me understand that being human doesn’t mean being small or trapped. It means exploring one version of a much bigger story. My art reflects this idea by showing many possibilities at once — different paths, layered spaces, and forms that feel alive rather than fixed.<br><br>
	 
	 This philosophy isn’t about escaping the world or pretending everything is perfect. It’s about learning how to belong without getting stuck. Just like a crystal can hold a beautiful pattern without trying to control the light passing through it, a person can live fully without being owned by fear, greed, or old stories. My hope is that when someone looks at my artwork, they feel a little more curious, a little more free, and a little more at home in the mystery of being alive — as if they are part of something vast, meaningful, and still unfolding.<br><br>
